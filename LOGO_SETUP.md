# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Logo

1. **Get your logo image**
   - The logo should be a PNG file with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 512x256px or larger
   - Format: PNG (with transparency)

2. **Place the logo file**
   - Save your logo as `cypher-hero-logo.png`
   - Place it in the `public/` folder:
     ```
     cypher-hero-app/
       public/
         cypher-hero-logo.png
     ```

3. **Where the logo appears**
   - **Splash Screen**: Animated logo on white background
   - **Game Board Center**: Logo in the central circle

4. **Fallback**
   - If the image file is not found, the app will automatically use a text-based logo with gradient colors
   - No action needed if you don't have the image file yet

## Logo Specifications

Based on your logo design:
- **Text**: "CYPHER HERO" (two lines)
- **Colors**: 
  - "CYPHER": Turquoise to purple gradient
  - "HERO": Orange to red gradient
- **Style**: Bold, stylized, graffiti-inspired font
